Designed around the NES gamepad (easy to understand input layout)
Linear progression (level based system e.g Super Mario World's overworld)
same healthbar for both players
each level should have it's own gimmick (a different item or a unique environmental challenge maybe?)
small bitesize levels
Asynchronous level design??
